Tools
=====

A simple repo to keep miscellaneous tools I write.

conntrackReport
---------------
A simple script to grep /proc/net/ip_conntrack for counts of TCP/UDP connections.

conntrack2Graphite.py
---------------------
I modified conntrackReport.py to feed Graphite it's data.  I borrowed code from Graphite's 'examples/example-client.py'.

Thanks to the Graphite devs for the example code.
